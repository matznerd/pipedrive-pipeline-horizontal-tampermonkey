Pipedrive pipeline's inexplicably do not have a scroll and the columns can be become tiny and unreadable, this is a Tampermonkey chrome extension plugin that fixes it so that a horizontal scroll is implemented. 

You just need the Chrome extension Tampermonkey, which is the Chrome version of Greasemonkey: https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo

Then you load in this script. The top line allows you to control the width of columns, I have it set at 175 px. 

There is no warrany on this, I made it with Anthropic's Claude. 

Pipedrive people, pleae implement this natively, thanks.
